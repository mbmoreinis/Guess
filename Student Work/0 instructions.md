# Instructions

This is a project that builds from our Dice rolling program. 
We are using folders to make things simpler. There is a 
Pseudocode folder (instructions) and a Done folder (your code).

We do it the way we do Katas: 
1. Copy the pseudocode into script, 
2. Change the button in index.html to match the function name, 
3. Coding in script until it works
4. Make a new file in the Done folder matching the pseudocode file
5. Paste your script into that new file
6. Paste your next pseudocode into script.

You are only ready for this project if you have finished 
1.5 The Main Function in CodeHS.  It's better if you have
finished 1.7.
