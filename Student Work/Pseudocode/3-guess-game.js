/* Guess Game Program */

// define function newGame

  // create a Boolean variable for again, set to true

  // create a Boolean variable for testing, set to true

  // loop as long as again is true 

    // run the guess function, with testing as argument

    // check the value of again to decide whether to play again.

    // set testing equal to false

    // close the loop

  // thank the player for playing

  // close the function

// create a function called guess, with testing as parameter

  // create guess and set equal to 0 

  // create tries and set equal to 0 

  // create variable answer and generate a random integer 1-100

  // display the integer for testing purposes only

  // loop while guess is not equal to answer

    // set guess equal to asking user to "Guess a number, 1-100"

    // add one to tries

    // if guess equals answer display "Correct in [tries] tries!" 

    // or if guess is greater than answer display "Too high!" 

    // or if guess is less than answer display "Too low!" 

    // if it's none of those, say "Bad Input!"

    // end the loop

  // end the function
